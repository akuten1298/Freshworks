# Freshworks FrontEnd 

Good Afternoon,
This is Aakash Mahalingam(120003001) CSE, Ex-Freshworks Intern :-)

There are two html files aku.html (landing page) and rec.html (second page). 
These two html files are supported by style sheets style.css and style2.css respectively.

Landing Page:
The landing page consists of title and search bar accompanied by a list of all countries with their flags. The user can also directly get more information about the country by clicking on the card. As the list of all countries is quite huge, a search bar easily facilitates the user by displaying only relevant cards. When these cards are clicked, the user is taken to another page which consists of relevant and important details regarding the country.

Second Page:
This page consists of a back button and a set of 9 cards each revealing different information about the country. These cards are neatly spaced and arranged in a matrix like manner for quick information gaining. A large back button at the top left of the screen return back to query page that brought us here.

This whole project facilitates the user by allowing him to gain quick basc information about any country he wants. And moreover this project was done keeping in mind all the necessary requirements:

1. The first page should have a search bar on top that should be used to search for any
country by making an API call. You can use APIs from https://restcountries.eu/.
2. The search results should be displayed on the same page as cards with the name and the
flag of the country, without refreshing the web page.
3. On clicking a card, the app should redirect to a page that shows country details. Display
all interesting details that are returned by the API. You are free to design this page as you
see fit.
4. The details page should have a link to go back to the previous page, where the search
results were displayed.


The complete functionality and workflow is commmented in the html files.
