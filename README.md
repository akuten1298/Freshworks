# Freshworks FrontEnd 

There are two html files aku.html (which is the landing page) and rec.html (this page displays country info). 
These two html files are supported by style sheets style.css and style2.css respectively.

Landing Page:
The landing page consists of title and search bar accompanied by a list of all countries with their flags. The user can also directly get more information about the country by clicking on the card. As the list of all countries is quite huge, a search bar easily facilitates the user by displaying only relevant cards. When these cards are clicked, the user is taken to another page which consists of relevant and important details regarding the country.

Second Page:
This page consists of a back button and a set of 9 cards each revealing different information about the country. These cards are neatly spaced and arranged in a matrix like manner for quick information gaining. A large back button at the top left of the screen return back to query page that brought us here.

This whole project facilitates the user by allowing him to gain quick basc information about any country he wants.

The complete functionality and workflow is commmented in the html files.
